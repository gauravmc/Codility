# Write a function:

#     def solution(a)

# that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximum number of flags that can be set on the peaks of the array.

# For example, the following array A:
#     A[0] = 1
#     A[1] = 5
#     A[2] = 3
#     A[3] = 4
#     A[4] = 3
#     A[5] = 4
#     A[6] = 1
#     A[7] = 2
#     A[8] = 3
#     A[9] = 4
#     A[10] = 6
#     A[11] = 2

# the function should return 3, as explained above.

# The O(N*logN) approach below gets overall 93% on Codility â€“ 100% on correctness and 85% on performance.
# It fails only 1 perf test, and with "running time: 1.32 sec., time limit: 1.14 sec."
